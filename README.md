# Flutter-App-Gradient-Color

- This code creates a simple Flutter app with a MaterialApp containing a Scaffold.
- The body consists of a Container with a BoxDecoration applying a LinearGradient background of orange, pink, and blue colors.
- Inside the container, there's a centered text widget displaying "Hello frink'n Developers!" in white color.

Feel free to copy and paste this Dart code into your Flutter project's main.dart file to see the gradient background along with the text displayed on the app screen!
